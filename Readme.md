EduToken Rewards

## Project Description
EduToken Rewards is a blockchain-based incentive system designed to reward educational engagement. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this smart contract facilitates the issuance of "EDU" tokens to incentivize and reward users for consuming educational content, such as videos. The project leverages decentralized technology to ensure transparency, security, and fairness in reward distribution.
